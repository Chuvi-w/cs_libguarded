libGuarded is a library for multithreaded programming. It provides
templated classes which prevent race conditions by controlling access
to shared data.

libGuarded is a standalone header-only library. The only requirement
is a C++11 compliant compiler and standard library. The autotools
build system is used only for building and running the unit test
suite.

Class level documentation is available on the CopperSpice website:
